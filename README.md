# Chronical
Description: Chronical is an journal app to jot down the user's thoughts, feelings and mood of the day. The name means relating to or controlled by time. This gives meaning to the purpose of the app which is for the users to have the ability to recount their days and their experience. The name also means that the users have time at their hands and it is up to them whether or not if they want to look back to those moments.

## Design Process
  The target audience for Chronical is for teenagers. Teenage life is mostly filled with exciting events, downfalls and a period of growing up. Hence, with this app they will be able to view what they have learnt or have gone through during that growing period.
  - As a user, I want to save my mood and my thoughts and be able to edit and delete it as well, so that I can look back at it and also be able to change it.
  - As a user, I want to view my saved thoughts in a calender and be also able to edit it.
  - As a user, I want the app to be in a minimalistic type of design and not cluttered.
