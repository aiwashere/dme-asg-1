This gives meaning to the purpose of the app which is for the users to have the ability to recount their days and their experience. The name also means that the users have time at their hands and it is up to them whether or not if they want to look back to those moments.

## Design Process
  The target audience for Chronical is for teenagers. Teenage life is mostly filled with exciting events, downfalls and a period of growing up. Hence, with this app they will be able to view what they have learnt or have gone through during that growing period.
